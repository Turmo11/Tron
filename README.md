# Tron

ABOUT THE GAME:

Tron is a 1v1 game where the main objective is to be the last one standing, the original game is played on neon motorcycles so we got insired by that an turned it into a neon spaceship battle

INSTRUCTIONS:

You can kill the opponents by shooting them and either of you will lose if you crash into the walls or the trail that the other player has left
 
If you were both to crash, the result would end up in a draw.

ISSUES/BUGS:
You may encounter some issues with the resolution of the screen, in that case modify the WIDTH and LENGTH at the top of the code so it suits your resolution

You may also find that sometimes the first time executing may generate some bugs, the easiest solution for that is rebooting the exe and pretending like nothing happened ;)

Finally this program does not take into account DeltaTime, therefore if you have higher or lower fps the movement might look different, we will be fixing that soon enough.

RECENTLY FIXED 

- green/purple player doesn't start winning right after compiling (collision border bug fixed)
- purple player does not spawn out of the map anymore
